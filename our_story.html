            <h2>Chapter One</h2>
            <h3>It Started With a Message</h3>

            <p>
                One ordinary day, a notification appeared on her screen.
                It was from him.
            </p>

            <p>
                They already knew each other — not strangers,
                just two familiar names in each other’s world.
                But that day felt different.
            </p>

            <p>
                He told her that he liked her.
                Simple words. No drama.
                Yet her heart paused for a second.
            </p>

            <p>
                Neither of them knew that something quiet
                had just begun —
                a journey they didn’t plan,
                a story they didn’t expect.
            </p>

            <p>
                They became good friends.
                They talked for hours.
                They laughed.
                And for the first time,
                she felt something she had never felt before.

            <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
            <h3>When It Became “Us”</h3>

            <p>
                Days passed, and their conversations became
                the favorite part of each day.
            </p>

            <p>
                What started as friendship slowly turned into
                something deeper, something warmer.
            </p>

            <p>
                One day, with a nervous heart,
                he finally said the words —
                he asked her to be his.
            </p>

            <p>
                In that moment, everything felt magical.
                No doubts. No fears.
                Just two hearts choosing each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                And that was the day their real story began —
                filled with laughter, late-night talks,
                and a happiness they had never known before.

            <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
            <h3>The Quiet Promises</h3>

            <p>
                She was an introvert.
                Words were never easy for her.
            </p>

            <p>
                She felt deeply,
                but expressing it was always the hardest part.
            </p>

            <p>
                Still, she made sure he knew —
                that her love was real,
                and it was only for him.
                Not for a moment,
                but for as long as her heart could feel.
            </p>

            <p>
                They shared something no one else understood.
                She had lost her father.
                He had lost his mother.
            </p>

            <p>
                Somewhere between their laughter and late-night talks,
                they found comfort in each other’s pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                It wasn’t just love.
                It was healing.
                Two incomplete hearts,
                quietly choosing each other.

                Their days were filled with laughter,
                comfort, and quiet happiness.
            </p>

            <p>
                They didn’t think about the world outside.
                They didn’t think about families,
                expectations, or reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                It felt simple.

            <p>
                Slowly, the worst phase of her life began.
                Responsibilities grew heavier.
                Silence became longer.
                Smiles became harder to hold.
            </p>

            <p>
                And for the first time,
                love wasn’t the only thing she had to fight for.

        Everything was going smoothly... like a calm river flowing under golden sunlight.  
        They were happy in their little world, unaware of the storm waiting ahead.  
        <br><br>
        Then one day, his past returned.  
        His ex came back into his life —  
        and slowly, everything started to change.  
        <br><br>
        The laughter became less.  
        The calls became shorter.  
        The warmth became colder.  
        <br><br>
        And her world…  
        the world she built with love and silence…  
        slowly began to turn dark.

        And slowly, she started losing him too.  
        <br><br>
        The arguments grew louder.  
        The misunderstandings became deeper.  
        Two hearts that once felt safe  
        now stood on opposite sides of silence.  
        <br><br>
        But maybe… God had more plans for them.  
        Maybe love was not meant to end like this.  
        <br><br>
        After tears, after fights, after painful nights —  
        they chose each other again.  
        Not perfectly.  
        Not easily.  
        But honestly.  
        <br><br>
        And their story…  
        began once more.

        It felt new.

        He apologized.  
        She apologized.  
        Not because love was weak —  
        but because it mattered.  
        <br><br>
        That day, she felt something deeper than before.  
        Not butterflies.  
        Not excitement.  
        But peace.

        His chats with his ex.

        At that day, they had met each other to spend time together,

        In that moment, she felt the world shift.  
        Confusion. Pain. Doubt.  
        <br><br>
        What was their relationship now?  
        Were the moments of happiness real?  
        Or were they just shadows of a story she didn’t know?  
        <br><br>
        Her heart was torn between love and fear,

        That day should have been filled with candles, laughter, and celebration.

        Tears blurred her vision as she left him silently.

        <br><br>
        She cried herself home,  
        her heart aching,  
        yet deep down, she never fully believed it was the end.  
        <br><br>
        Love had left a mark too strong to forget,  
        and trust had been shattered,  
        but hope…  
        even a little, remained.

    <h1>Chapter 10 — The Tears of Love</h1>

    <p>
        After days of silence,  
        a message appeared on her phone.  
        His words were trembling,  
        filled with regret and longing.  
        <br><br>
        That evening, he stood in front of her, tears rolling down his cheeks.  
        His voice cracked as he whispered:  
        <br><br>
        "<strong>I can’t live without you. I need you. Please don’t leave me.</strong>"  
        <br><br>
        She felt her heart swell,  
        all the pain and misunderstandings flooding back,  
        but now mingled with hope.  
        <br><br>
        In that moment, they didn’t need words.  
        Only tears, hugs, and promises.  
        The love that had once been shaken  
        now felt stronger, unbreakable,  
        as if the universe had given them a second chance.

        Slowly, life became smooth again.  
        She felt safe, loved, and understood.  
        <br><br>
        Before he left for his relatives’ home for the festival,  
        he met her one last time,  
        holding a single flower in his hand.  
        <br><br>
        “I love you,” he whispered softly,  
        and she smiled, feeling her heart flutter.  
        <br><br>
        They laughed together,  
        teasing and sharing stories,  
        the kind of laughter that warms the soul.  
        <br><br>
        That day, their bond grew even stronger.  
        Every smile, every hug, every word of love  
        became a promise that no distance could break.

        After he left for his relatives’ home,  
        she noticed something changing.  
        The messages stopped.  
        Calls became rare.  
        And for days, she heard nothing from him.  
        <br><br>
        At first, she thought he was just busy.  
        Work, festivals, family obligations…  
        She trusted him. She loved him.  
        <br><br>
        Every day without a message felt a little longer,  
        but she held onto faith.  
        She believed in their love,  
        believing he would come back to her soon.  
        <br><br>
        Yet the silence lingered,  
        and her heart quietly ached,  
        learning that distance could be heavier than words.

        Finally, he came back home.  
        Her heart fluttered with hope, longing for the warmth they shared.  
        <br><br>
        But soon, she noticed it…  
        The messages weren’t answered.  
        Calls went unanswered.  
        And despite being online, he kept ignoring her.  
        <br><br>
        She waited, believing he was busy,  
        holding onto trust and love.  
        But the truth hurt more than silence.  
        <br><br>
        Her heart ached, confusion and fear blending together.  
        Love felt fragile again,  
        as if every moment of happiness could slip through her fingers.  
        <br><br>
        She realized that sometimes, distance isn’t measured in miles…  
        but in the unseen walls built between hearts.

        She was scrolling aimlessly, trying to distract her heart…  
        when she saw a story.  
        A girl had shared a post, tagging him.  
        <br><br>
        Her chest tightened.  
        The story was casual, yet it carried a weight she couldn’t ignore.  
        In that story, the girl mentioned something about him…  
        something she didn’t understand,  
        leaving a knot of confusion and pain in her heart.  
        <br><br>
        She stared at the screen,  
        questioning everything —

        In that moment, life felt fragile again,

        "<strong>Why did you tag her? Who is she?</strong>"  
        <br><br>
        He laughed awkwardly,  
        claiming, "It’s my sister, nothing else."  
        <br><br>
        But she knew it wasn’t true.  
        Her heart ached,  
        and confusion burned inside her.  
        <br><br>
        Repeatedly, they argued.  
        Words clashed, voices rose,  
        neither willing to give ground.  
        <br><br>
        She felt betrayed,  
        though deep down she still loved him.  
        He tried to explain,  
        but the tension only grew.  
        <br><br>
        That night, their silence was louder than words,  
        and the walls between them felt higher than ever.

        The pain, betrayal, and exhaustion overwhelmed her.  
        She felt like she had tolerated too much, and her heart couldn’t take it anymore.  
        <br><br>
        She didn’t want to go back home.  
        She felt lost, hopeless, and alone.  
        <br><br>
        For a moment, she thought of ending it all…  
        but somewhere deep inside, a small voice whispered that life still had a chance,

        <br><br>
        And though tears poured and heart ached,

        The world outside felt distant, meaningless.  
        <br><br>
        That whole day, she couldn’t eat a single bite.  
        The night came, but her tears did not stop.  
        Her sobs echoed in the silent room,  
        each one carrying the weight of betrayal, loss, and endless pain.  
        <br><br>
        She tried to speak, tried to explain her feelings to herself,  
        but words failed — the feelings were too vast, too raw to capture.  
        <br><br>
        Hours passed in darkness,  
        the night stretching endlessly,  
        yet somehow, the very act of crying let her heart release a little of the pain she had carried alone.  
        <br><br>
        In that night of despair, she realized some feelings cannot be described —  
        only felt.  
        And sometimes, surviving the night is the first step toward a new day.

        After months of pain and darkness,

        <br><br>
        She sought counseling,

        Slowly, day by day,  
        she began to heal.  
        The tears didn’t disappear overnight,  
        but they became lighter, more like rain washing away the sorrow.  
        <br><br>
        After two months, she started anew —  
        a life shaped by resilience, courage, and self-love.  
        She rediscovered her laughter,  
        her passions, and the simple joys she had forgotten.  
        <br><br>
        Though the past left its mark,  
        she now embraced the future with hope.  
        The night of endless tears had ended,  
        and a new dawn had begun.

        he no longer seemed happy.  
        <br><br>
        He stopped eating properly,  
        spending hours alone in his room,  
        a shadow of the vibrant person she once knew.

        Her heart ached for him,  
        and she felt a quiet responsibility,  
        wondering what could have caused his suffering.  
        <br><br>
        With care and caution,  
        she decided to reach out —  
        through social media,  
        hiding her identity,  
        simply to understand what was happening in his world.  
        <br><br>
        Even from afar,  
        she wanted to ensure he wasn’t lost in his own darkness,  
        her concern quietly bridging the distance between them.

        Laughs, shared stories, and small confessions  
        bridged the distance between them.

        Days passed, and he slowly began to understand —  
        realizing the truth behind the anonymous kindness.  
        <br><br>
        One day, without hesitation,  
        he sent a direct message,  
        acknowledging his mistakes,

        <br><br>
        "I am truly sorry for last time. Please forgive me," he wrote.

        words cutting deeper than ever before.  
        <br><br>
        She saw clearly now.  
        No amount of love, patience, or hope could fix this.

        <br><br>
        She took a deep breath,

        Every word carried the weight of months of pain,

        waiting for him,  
        hoping that love — the love they had fought for, endured, and survived —  
        might still find its way back.
